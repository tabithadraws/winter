This is a snow simulator that you can control using an arduino! Here are the things you need:
- Arduino Micro
- Potentiometer
- A bunch of wires and things
- A breadboard

The project was made using a p5 example that you can find here. This is a large part of the project so thanks to the person who made it!:

I also used some code from my instructor that allows you to control the Arduino, but I'm not sure if that's available to the public..? I am still also learning how github works.

If you want to use an image for the background like I did you will need to create a local server. This is a good explainer video:

You will also need to download p5 serial control to get the Arduino to talk to the computer. It's a strange new world out there, people.

You can read my blog post for further insights from a newb.
